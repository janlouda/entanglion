# Entanglion Printing & Assembly Guide
Ready to assemble your own copy of Entanglion? Let's get started!

> Note: It can take a few hours to cut out and assemble the paper game pieces, and longer if you are 3D printing any game components. Please be patient as you assemble your game, we promise it's worth it! ðŸ˜‡

## Step 1. Download Game Assets
The first step is to download the Entanglion game assets.

## Step 2. Print, Purchase, or Re-purpose?
Many of the Entanglion game assets need to be printed, but there are some choices you can make in how to print them. Additionally, some game assets can be purchased or re-purposed from other games. Please refer to the table below to determine how you will assemble your own copy of Entanglion.

| Asset | Options |
| --- | --- |
| Game board, spaceship boards, engine cards, quantum event cards, quantum components, spaceship tokens, detection rate token | Print on Letter (8.5x11"), A4 (8.27Ã—11.69"), or Poster (24" wide) paper |
| 2 spaceship tokens | _Optional_ 3D print |
| 1 detection rate token | _Optional_ 3D print |
| 1 Centarious die (binary d6) | 3D print, re-purpose (e.g. a coin), or [Buy on Amazon](http://a.co/0cW7fsG) |
| 1 Entanglion die (d8) | 3D print, re-purpose, or [Buy on Amazon](http://a.co/aNyVaz9) |
| Rule Book | Print on Letter (8.5x11") paper |

> Looking to save printer ink? We've included a light-themed version for Letter and A4 sized paper.

## Step 3. Printing

### Paper Selection
Many of the Entanglion game components are designed to be printed on a standard inkjet or laser printer. However, the standard paper used by these printers is a bit flimsy when used for making a board game. We recommend printing on heavyweight (cardstock) paper with a weight of 80 to 110lbs if possible. Alternatively, the game components can be printed and mounted on museum board, foam core, or other mounting surface.

### Printer Settings
When printing, make sure to print single sided at 100% with no scaling, at the highest quality setting.

### Glue or Tape?
When printing the Letter (8.5x11") or A4 (8.27Ã—11.69") versions of the game and spaceship boards, we have left room to affix the different pieces together. You may use either tape or glue to affix the pieces. We have found that taping the back sides of the pieces together allows the boards to be folded in half, whereas glue provides a sturdier hold.

### 3D Printing
We have included a number of 3D models, some of which can be used in place of the 2D versions in the PDF file. We have printed these components with a MakerBot Replicator, but any 3D printer should be able to handle these prints.

| Component | Color | Fill | Raft | Supports | Tips |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spaceship tokens | One red, one blue | 50% | Yes | Yes | Try printing a large version for fun! ðŸš€ |
| Detection rate token | Any color, be creative! ðŸ™ƒ | 10% | Yes | No | We like using white for the detection rate token |
| Centarious d6 die | Purple | 100% | Yes | No | Orient part with the number "1" face down on the printer bed |
| Entanglion d8 die | Yellow | 100% | Yes | No | Orient part with the number "1" face down on the printer bed |

> If you do not have access to a 3D printer, you may purchase the dice on Amazon ([Centarious binary d6](http://a.co/0cW7fsG), [Entanglion d8](http://a.co/aNyVaz9)), or repurpose appropriately-sided dice from other board games.

### Rule Book
We have included the full-color version of the rule book in the game assets. However, it is possible that we may update the rules based on community feedback. The authoritative source of Entanglion rules will be maintained in the [online rulebook](../game), and any errata or rule clarifcations will be documented on the [errata page](../game/Errata.md).

## Step 4. Play Time! ðŸš€
Congratulations on assembling your own copy of Entanglion. We hope you enjoy playing it!
